# Linear Equations Solver

This Python program solves a system of linear equations using the numpy library.

## Description

This program takes user input for the number of variables and equations and then prompts the user to enter the equations. It validates the input equations, ensuring they are properly formatted with the equal sign and the correct number of variables. The program uses matrix operations from the numpy library to solve the system of equations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy library

## Usage

1. Enter the number of different variables each equation should have.
2. Make sure the quantity of equations matches the number of variables.

# Example

```
Please enter the number of different variables each equation should have: 3

Please note that the quantity of equations must match the number of variables provided.

Please enter the equation here: 2x + 3y - z = 8
Please enter the equation here: x - 2y + 4z = -2
Please enter the equation here: 3x - y + 2z = 10

The value of x: 1.0
The value of y: 2.0
The value of z: 3.0

```
